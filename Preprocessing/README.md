Contains code for:
- processing cSLE from GEO
- running WNN on JDM
- attempts to combine cSLE and JDM so far

Note -- only the `process_jdm` and `utils` scripts have been cleaned up.
To run, variables CODE_DIR and JDM_DIR must be set.

`deprecated` and `scratch_plotting` include code used previously but that is not in a later iteration.
